\section{Concept of Operations}
The purpose of PiFeed is to be able to remotely monitor and control a fish tank
and cat feeder from the internet. The system will be composed of two
Raspberry Pi's and one computer. Rasp1 will collect information about the fish
tank and control the fish feeder. Rasp2 will collect information about the cat
and control the cat feeder. A user will interface with the two Raspberry Pi's
with a client application and be able to monitor both the aquarium and the cat
feeder using Pi cameras. Additionaly the client application will allow the user
to customize the feeders and control them manually. The following figure shows
a high level description of the two raspbery Pi's.

\section{System Overview}
PiFeed is separated into the following modules: PiFeedControl, PiFeedFish, and
PiFeedCat. The programming language that will be used is Python. Rabbitmq will
be used for publishing the sensor information and images from both the fish tank
and cat bowls to a message broker that the PiFeedControl client application can
subscribe to. The Rabbitmq server will be located on a machine on the same
network that Rasp1 and Rasp2 are connected on. Python sockets will be used for
controlling the feeders remotely and the LCD connected to Rasp2.

\subsection{PiFeedControl}
The purpose of this module is to be able to allow a user to remotely access and
control the feeders as well as write messages to the LCD display connected to
Rasp2. The module is a python client application and can be run using either the
local network or the internet. It will talk to PiFeedCat and PiFeedFish by
subscribing to a message broker that routes the messages from the two modules.
It will use sockets to manually start the feeders and configure the feeders for
automatic feeding as well as for writing to the LCD display connected to Rasp2.

\subsection{PiFeedCat}
The purpose of this module is to publish messages to a message broker containing
information generated by the sensors on the cat bowls as well as images from the
Pi camera mounted on the bowls. It also controls the hardware for the automatic
cat feeder and the LCD.

\subsection{PiFeedFish}
The purpose of this module is to publish messages to a message broker containing
information generated by the sensors on the fish tank as well as images from the
Pi camera mounted on the tank. It also controls the hardware for the automatic
fish tank feeder.

\subsection{Testable Requirements}
A completely succesful project should demonstrate that the following requirements
are satisfied.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item PiFeedControl is able to remotely feed the fish both manually and at
          specific times of the day.
    \item PiFeedControl is able to remotely feed the cat both manually and at
          specific times of the day.
    \item PiFeedControl is able to remotely monitor the fish using the Pi camera.
    \item PiFeedControl is able to remotely monitor the cat using the Pi camera.
    \item PiFeedControl is able to remotely view the fish tank sensors.
    \item PiFeedControl is able to remotely view the cat tank sensors.
    \item PiFeedFish is able to feed the fish.
    \item PiFeedFish is able to interface with the sensors on the fish tank and
          get correct readings.
    \item PiFeedCat is able to feed the cat.
    \item PiFeedCat is able to interface with the sensors on the cat bowls and
          get correct readings.
